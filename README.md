Pub life can be fun, until it's not... A simple program to simulate the misdoings of irresponsible lager louts

I'm refactoring the tests and classes from Hadi's original exercise

We have 3 classes
Pint - can be drunk, broken
Punter - can become drunk, fight with other punters
Pub - serves Pints, contains Punters

This is mainly an exercise to get practice with Rspec tests and doubles
